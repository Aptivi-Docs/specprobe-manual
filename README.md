# Welcome!

Welcome to SpecProbe! It's not only a reboot of Inxi.NET that probes all hardware information from your computer, such as your graphics card, your CPU, and your hard drives, but also provides you with some platform-specific tools that are useful, such as loading native libraries.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Starting from SpecProbe 2.0.1, we no longer support 32-bit architectures. In case you need to support 32-bit platforms, you can still use 2.0.0, but you'll miss out in both improvements and in additions. We recommend you to ditch 32-bit support as soon as you can.
{% endhint %}

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.
