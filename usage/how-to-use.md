# How to use

This library is simple to use compared to Inxi.NET. You can selectively parse hardware and get information for each part that is currently supported by SpecProbe below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="267">Type</th><th>Property</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor (CPU)</td><td><code>HardwareProber.GetProcessor()</code></td></tr><tr><td>Graphics Card (GPU)</td><td><code>HardwareProber.GetVideos()</code></td></tr><tr><td>System Memory (RAM)</td><td><code>HardwareProber.GetMemory()</code></td></tr><tr><td>Storage Devices (HDD, SSD, NVMe, eMMC, ...)</td><td><code>HardwareProber.GetHardDisks()</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Once you call these properties, the parser relevant to the part that you need to get information will try to fetch info from the hardware in native ways.

You can invalidate the cache using the `InvalidateCache()` function from the same class for benchmarking and other purposes.

## Benchmark Results

The benchmark shows the comparison of performance of SpecProbe and Inxi.NET in their default settings. with a dry job running the hardware probe only once.

* SpecProbe: CPU, GPU, RAM, and HDD (3.2.0)
* Inxi.NET: CPU, GPU, RAM, and HDD (2022.5.0.4)

```
BenchmarkDotNet v0.14.0, Windows 11 (10.0.22631.4317/23H2/2023Update/SunValley3)
Intel Core i7-8700 CPU 3.20GHz (Coffee Lake), 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores
.NET SDK 8.0.403

| Method                   | Mean       | Error |
|------------------------- |-----------:|------:|
| ProbeEverythingInxiNet   | 2,356.4 ms |    NA |
| ProbeEverythingSpecProbe |   434.1 ms |    NA |
```

Inxi.NET took `2,356.4` milliseconds, or `2.3` seconds, to probe all the supported hardware types, while SpecProbe only took `434.1` milliseconds for all the supported types mentioned above. This makes SpecProbe faster than Inxi.NET.

## Software

In addition to the hardware parser that SpecProbe provides, this library also provides a separate NuGet package that allows you to get software information, including your kernel version.

### Kernel version

Just use the `UnameManager` class that contains:

* `GetUname(UnameTypes)`

This function queries information about your kernel and its basic information, like your system architecture and your kernel version, based on the passed `uname` flags. Currently, it supports all the portable flags in `UnameTypes`:ï¸Ž

* Kernel name (`UnameTypes.KernelName`)
* Kernel release (`UnameTypes.KernelRelease`)
* Kernel version (`UnameTypes.KernelVersion`)
* Network host name (`UnameTypes.NetworkNode`)
* Machine architecture (`UnameTypes.Machine`)
* Operating system (`UnameTypes.OperatingSystem`)

### Platform

You can also query the platform of your choice using functions defined in the `PlatformHelper` class. It allows you to check to see if the host is running Windows or Linux, and more. It also allows you to get the terminal emulator and the type. You can detect .NET Framework, too!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also check to see if a program is running from either a GRILO bootable environment (`IsRunningFromGrilo()`) or a Nitrocid environment (`IsRunningFromNitrocid()`).
{% endhint %}

You can also use the RID graph reader by using `GetGraphFromRid()` found in the `RidGraphReader` class to get all the RIDs that can be used to resolve them to basically the base RID.

## Native Libraries

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is put here to prepare for the merger of NativeLand and SpecProbe in the v2.x.x version series of SpecProbe.
{% endhint %}

`SpecProbe.Loader` contains a class that manages how to load the libraries according to both the operating system and the architecture specification using different paths, called `LibraryManager`. This allows you to load native libraries by copying the native library file or stream to a file in the application executable directory.

You just need to get a path to a native library file using a file path that you've specified. This is an example of how to create a new instance of the library manager from a file path:

```csharp
var platform = PlatformHelper.GetPlatform();
var bitness = PlatformHelper.GetArchitecture();
switch (platform)
{
    case Platform.Windows:
        libManager = bitness switch
        {
            Architecture.X64 =>
                new LibraryManager(new LibraryFile(libX64Path)),
            Architecture.Arm64 =>
                new LibraryManager(new LibraryFile(libArm64Path)),
            _ =>
                throw new PlatformNotSupportedException("32-bit systems are no longer supported."),
        };
        break;
    case Platform.Linux:
    case Platform.MacOS:
        switch (bitness)
        {
            case Architecture.X64:
                libManager = new LibraryManager(
                    new LibraryFile(libX64Path));
                break;
            case Architecture.Arm:
            case Architecture.X86:
                throw new PlatformNotSupportedException("32-bit systems are no longer supported.");
        }
        break;
}

// Load the native library
libManager.LoadNativeLibrary();
```

Once you're done creating new instances of library manager classes, you can now load all of them when needed, as in `LoadNativeLibrary()`. To verify that it's truly loaded, use the `GetNativeMethodDelegate<T>()` method, pointing the generic type argument to your function delegate that matches the native library signatures. This is an example of how to call a native library function:

```csharp
private delegate int Hello();

private static int SayHello()
{
    // Load native library like the code above
    [...]
    
    // Get the hello result from the delegate
    var @delegate = libManager.GetNativeMethodDelegate<Hello>("hello");
    int result = @delegate.Invoke();
    
    // Print the result
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

### Environment tools

SpecProbe also implements a class called `EnvironmentTools` that allows you to use the functions related to querying and setting environment variables for native libraries. Currently, you can get and set an environment variable with the following methods:

* Using .NET (managed): This uses the [`Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariable?view=net-8.0) function and the [`Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.setenvironmentvariable?view=net-8.0) function, but it might not be effective for some native libraries on Windows and all native libraries on Unix.
  * `GetEnvironmentVariableManaged()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableManaged()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableAppendManaged()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableNoOverwriteManaged()`
* Using UCRT: This uses the [`getenv_s()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-s-wgetenv-s?view=msvc-170) function and the [`_putenv_s()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/putenv-s-wputenv-s?view=msvc-170) function, and it's effective for UCRT-based native libraries built for Windows.
  * `GetEnvironmentVariableUcrt()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableUcrt()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableAppendUcrt()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableNoOverwriteUcrt()`
* Using LIBC: This uses the [`getenv()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html) function and the [`setenv()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setenv.3.html) function, and it's effective for Unix native libraries.
  * `GetEnvironmentVariableLibc()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableLibc()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableAppendLibc()`
  * `SetEnvironmentVariableNoOverwriteLibc()`

## Device IDs

SpecProbe manages all device IDs according to the available databases. Currently, as of 3.2.0, it provides two types of such database:

* PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) IDs
* USB (Universal Serial Bus) IDs

### PCI IDs

SpecProbe now manages PCI IDs for all known devices that you can find in the PCI ID database that you can download [here](https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/). You can use the `PciListParser` class that lets you get vendors, devices, subdevices, and get their information. It also contains device class management.

### USB IDs

SpecProbe manages USB IDs for all known USB devices ranging from USB mass storage devices to external hard drives to mouses and keyboards. This is based on a database of known USB devices that you can download [here](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb-ids.html). You can use the `UsbListParser` class that lets you get the following:

* Vendors
  * Device
    * Protocol
* Classes
  * Subclasses
* Audio terminals
* Video terminals
* Human Interface Devices (HIDs)
* HID items
* Physical biases
* Physical descriptors
* HID usage pages
  * HID usages
* Languages
  * Dialects
* Country codes
